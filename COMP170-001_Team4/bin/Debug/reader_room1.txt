*Thud*
Getting up in a daze, you begin to look around the room.
Immediately you notice that there are no doors. However, there are many objects around the room.
Begin entering your commands to figure out how to solve this puzzle!

Try typing specific commands in multiple ways so that the computer
understands you. Often, the hints of the command are in the dialogue.
For example, if the bed looks good to nap on, you can simple type
'nap' in order to nap on the bed. However, the most common commands
that you can always do, is 'look around', 'examine (object)', 'use (object)', 'use (item) on (item)'
or 'help' to see this menu again. 
Note: You don't need to 'examine under bed' or things of that specific nature. Saying 'examine bed'
will tell you everything about the bed. What's on top of it, or underneath it.
The same goes for other objects.
Good luck loser!

Bruh

You look frantically around the room. It is just one large square box room.
No doors anywhere to be seen, just walls.
On one side you see a poster and coat rack with a trench coat on it.

On the other side, you see a desk that faintly reminds you of a boring desk job.

Then, on the 3rd side of the room sits a rather large bed.
Beside the bed lies a tan rug that sits in the middle of the room.

And the last side of the room has a bookshelf.

I don't understand

A hammer has been added to your inventory! Type 'examine hammer' to inspect it.

That is not effective.

The bookshelf contains many books. Some organized. And some disorganized.
"Game of Thrones"..."1984"..."Outliers"
However, one noticeable book stands out. A red book that seems to call out to you.

The poster reads 'Join Comp 170, Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming'. 
And the words seem to glow off the page, almost as if it was some magic calling to you.

The book is red all over and very fragile. Opening it, dust flies out. 
As your eyes clear up from the dust, you make out the words, "Bruh, look closer".
Flipping through each page, you are insulted by the same condescending phrase.

Looking closer at the bookshelf, you don't notice too mu--
Hold up!
Frantically removing all the books from the bookshelf, you realize that the wall is
made of different material from behind the bookshelf. It's not steel like the walls around the room.
This seems to be a normal wall. Almost.
You should move the bookshelf to get a better view.

Please stop. You're just embarrassing yourself. You're not as strong as Iri. Bro, do you even lift?

You slam the bookshelf on the floor, and in doing so, revealing the vulnerable wall.
When using commands on the vulnerable wall, refer to it as 'vulnerable wall'

You hear the wall crack, but after a few more poundings with the hammer, 
you realize that it's going to need something extra.

A trench coat appears to be on the coat rack.

Putting on the coat, you realize there is nothing special. However, you feel pretty swagful.

The boring desk job seems to be covered with a mess. On top of the desk, you spot
a computer, some paper clips, a PaperMate pen, and a delicious green apple. 
Your stomach grumbles.
The desk also contains many drawers that you can examine.

Pulling out each drawer wide open one by one. You are able to find a journal, a screwdriver, hammer,
old cheese, and a AWP(Sniper)) with one bullet. How a sniper came out of a drawer
makes no sense to me too. 

You have added a cross typed screwdriver to your inventory. Type 'examine screwdriver' to view it!

You already have that item! Don't get greedy!

The computer is broken. 
No matter how many times you try to press the power button, it won't turn on. 
Seems to be useless. Like Iri's old computer.

The paper clips are utterly useless. 
You throw them in a fit, angry that you aren't bright enough to get out of the room.

You have added a blue pen to your inventory. Type 'examine pen' to view it!

You already have that item! Don't get greedy!

You have added an AWP to your inventory. Type 'examine gun' to view it.

You have killed yourself. What did you hope to accomplish? Game Over.

The bullet ricochets off the wall, injuring you. Sad that the only target you can hit is yourself.
You have lost 1 HP.

The bullet hits the poster. It stirs up on the ground. 
It glows purple all around. 
And in an instant, the bullet flies back into your AWP.

For commands with the magic gun, use 'magic gun' rather than 'gun'.

The wall breaks down. Light comes out from the end of the tunnel. Do you choose to 'escape room'?

You have escaped the hellish room. Congratulations!

It's old disgusting cheese.

You take a bite. Why would you eat old disgusting cheese?! Now your injured. Good job.
You have lost 1 HP.

You took another bite. 
You have lost 1 more HP.
Your getting closer to dying, and that seems to be a good thing.

Your injuries have bested you. You have collapsed and died. Game Over.

The apple tastes amazing, but immediately you begin to vomit. 
The green apple chunks are surrounded by the acid from your stomach along with blood.
You have lost 1 HP.

You throw your body on the bed, anticipating the kind of nap Rares would take.
OW!
You jump off the bed with holes all over your back. Looking back at the bed,
you see spikes that pierced through the covers and injuring you. Blood drips all over.
You have lost 1 HP.

In an attempt to examine the rug, you idiotically slip on the rug.
You have fallen and cracked your skull. Touching your skull, you feel something squishy. 
You have lost 1 HP.

You have added the Journal to your inventory. Type 'examine journal' to read its contents.

Current HP:

The bed faintly reminds you of the one you had in your old room. The cute little puppies
that always protected you from the monsters at night just seems so inviting now.
You really could use a nap, but you probably shouldn't.
